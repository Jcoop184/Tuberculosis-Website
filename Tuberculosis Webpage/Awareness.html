<h1><left>Statistics</left></h1>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s deadliest diseases: One fourth of the world’s population is infected with TB. In 2016, 10.4 million people around the world became sick with TB disease. There were 1.7 million TB-related deaths worldwide. TB is a leading killer of people who are HIV infected.
A total of 9,272 TB cases (a rate of 2.9 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported in the United States in 2016. This is a decrease from the number of cases reported in 2015 and the lowest case count on record in the United States. The case rate of 2.9 per 100,000 persons is a 3.6% decrease from 2015. While the United States continues to make slow progress, current strategies are not enough to reach the goal of TB elimination in this century.In 2016, 9% of georgia's TB cases were homeless people, 2% were residents of correctional facilities, 83% of the Incarcerated Tb poplulation were inmates in county jails 17% were inmates of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.  according to The Georgia Department of Health. TB affects minorities disproportionately in Georgia. Non-Hispanic Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics accounted for 49%, 23% and 15% of TB cases in Georgia, while only representing 32%, 4% and 10% of Georgia’s population respectively. Non-Hispanic whites constituted 13% of TB cases in 2016. The black nonHispanic TB case rate, however, was still more than six times higher than the white non-Hispanic TB case rate (0.8 per 100,000) in Georgia during 2016

    <p class="one">The slope of our data represents that rate at which TB has decreased in the past 5 years. 1.09. Our table represents the number of TB cases for the past 20 years, from 1996-2016. The table data fluctuates so much, it’s difficult to formulate a reliable equation that can be used to predict an accurate number of TB cases in the future. However, Desmos has assisted us in forming an equation that can be used to predict that approximate amount of TB cases in the future (depending on what X is). The equation is y = -22.68x + 772. Based on the equation that data shows a trend of decreasing number of cases. Most of our data is on paper, but the graph is on Desmos.</p>
