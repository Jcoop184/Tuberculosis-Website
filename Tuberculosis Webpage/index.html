<h2><center>Tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease that plagues the lungs and causes severe health problems. We, Jalil Cooper and Etimfon Bassey became passionate about how important it was to inform incarcerated people and their relatives on the impact tuberculosis has on them, due to the high rates of tuberculosis in jails. We believe an education and change in behaviors involving behaviors can help alter how TB infections are able to spread quickly among incarcerated people.<img src="Images/i%20am%20locked%20up1.jpg"

<h3><left>What Do We Do</left></h3>
<p>Tuberculosis. An infectious lung disease cauased by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. My partner and I came togther to form Zero Fatigue, and tackle our how might we quetion. Our statement is, "How might we prevent the rampant spread of Tuberculosis in the prison industrial complex?"Zero Fatigue is entitled to finding a solution to out how might we statement. By going through the design process, brainstorming, research, interviews, feedback, optimal solution
We were able to reach a valid solution. Based of our research are current purpose is to design a prototype, and educate users about TB and inform them on how to prevent TB in their community.</p>

<h3><left>Our Process</left></h3>
<p><left>Being black a man of color in America is being born with a disadvantage. From a young age kids of color learn if your not white, in white america you are going to be treated different, whether if it's systematically through institutionalized racism, or just straightforward discrimination because of race. The most common form of institutionalized racism is the prison industrial complex. The rates at which black males are incarcerated, is disappointing. 1 in 3 African-American males are expected to be thrown in prison. As a result they are basically being enslaved, much like their ancestors long ago, and as most of us know slavery was a vile, destructive part of our history, because as a race they stripped us of our human rights and abused their power. Today is no different, and it has lead to an extremely high rate of Tuberculosis within prisons We began our research by learning as much as we could about Tuberculosis without any clear objective in mind or guideline question to focus our research on. We made very little progress with our initial information, so on the second week we formulated our research question, and began gaining more data on TB rates in prison and in Georgia. After gathering all the statistics we were able to form an tables, graphs, and later an equation to help us predict future data. After that we made our own inforgraphic and Social Justice flyer to advertise and inform people on the dangers of TB and how the prison industrial complex dehumaizes inmates by applying very little effort to the cleanliness, and icreasing chances of Tuberulosis among them.</left></p>

<h3>Symptoms and Causes</h3>
<p>Coughing that lasts three or more weeks, coughing up blood, chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, chills, loss of appetite. Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air. This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings. Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch. You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger. Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious.</p>
