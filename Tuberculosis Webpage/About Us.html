<p>My name is Jalil Cooper and I am a rising sophmore at Maynard Jackson. I live in a family of four with my mom, dad, and little brother. My story begins in Birmingham, Alabama, where I was born on October 15, 2002. As a child my family moved around very often. After my parent graduated and had me they moved to aa apartment in the suburbs, outside of Atlanta. Then when I startd elementary school we moved to cobb county, and gave birth to my younger brother, and not to long after we moved  again to town homes in Grant Park, and attended Atlanta Neighborhood Charter School aka ANCS. AFter I finished fifth grade we moved again, over to the west side of Atlanta in West End. We lived there for 3 years (my whole middle school) and then my grandma moved in during my seventh grade year in April of 2016. Due to her addition to our little family home we needed more space, so in October of that year we moved to our current home back in East Atlanta. I went on in my last year of middle school, and went on to attend Maynard in the following school year for ninth grade, with some personal family issues between that time, but now we live "happily ever after. Before I came to SMASH I was not even intrested in pursuing a STEM career. To some extent majoring in a STEM field is just one consideration. However, as of this year I read an intriguing article that has sparked my intrest in working in biomedical sceinces.</p>

<p>About me,  My name is Etimfon Bassey, I am a first-year scholar here at the SMASH Academy I became familiar with Tuberculosis at a young age when I contracted it. Tuberculosis is not only fatal but affects a disproportionate amount of minorities. I became especially concerned with how rampant Tuberculosis spreads among incarcerated people-specifically African American males who are the most likely to be imprisoned in America.- due to a lack of sanitation and proper human rights.</p>
